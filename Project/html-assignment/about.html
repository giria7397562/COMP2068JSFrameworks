        <h3 id="origins">Origins of the term</h3>
        <p>The term is derived from the name of the town of Spa, Belgium, whose name is known back from Roman times, when
the location was called Aquae Spadanae, sometimes incorrectly connected to the Latin word spargere meaning to
scatter, sprinkle or moisten. The word spa itself denotes "fountain". Some experts also suggest that the word "spa"
originated from the name of the Belgian town named Spa where a curative natural spring was discovered in the 14th
century. </p>

        <h3 id="treatments">Treatments</h3>
        <p>
         A 'body treatment', 'spa treatment', or 'cosmetic treatment' is non-medical procedure to help the health of the body. It is
often performed at a resort, destination spa, day spa, beauty salon or school. 
        </p>

        <h3 id="trends">Recent trends</h3>
        <p>
          In the modern world spa therapies are linked to various domains including beauty, pampering, indulgence, and health.
Spa industry is thought to be growing at a significantly high rate, and most importantly it is observed to embrace
wellness as its core business. By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the
United States. 
        </p>
